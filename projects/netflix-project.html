          <h2>What if Netflix delivered you the drinks and dishes of your favorite series characters?</h2>

          <h3>A UX/UI case</h3>

          <p>We all have strong connection with our favorite series’ characters. For fun, we have created a feature that offers the possibility to Netflix’s users to order their favorite character’s meals & drinks online.</p>

        <h3>Netflix world</h3>

        <p>Let’s start with the basics. Netflix, Inc. is an American media-services provider and production company. Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. Netflix has over 167 million subscribers.</p>

        <p>Since its arrival on the market, Netflix remains the world leader in SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand). However, its competitors are growing at an incredible speed and are increasingly present.</p>

        <p>Who are they ?</p>

        <p>Amazon Prime, Disney+, Hulu, HBO, Canal + Series, Salto, …</p>

        <p>But the direct competition do not seem to be a problem for Netflix. Indirect competition is the toughest. “We compete with (and lose ahead of) Fortnite more than HBO”, declared Netflix. Fortnite, with its 200 million players, offers an experience that is sometimes so captivating that players effectively forget to “binge watcher” series on Netflix. Another great rival? Youtube. When YouTube suffered a 90-minute outage last October, many viewers turned to Netflix, and the platform even registered a few new subscriptions during the outage.</p>

        <h3>My first idea</h3>

        <p>Did you know that Netflix subscribers spend 1 billion hours watching movies weekly ? It is huge ! And did you know that 39% of Netflix subscribers are sometimes forgetting to do their chores to watch Netflix ?</p>

        <p>As Netflix dumps full series online, people are no longer watching just one episode of some particular show each week. They are now watching television and online series in a way that changes how they spend their time.</p>

        <p>Everyday users with a Netflix account can sit down in front of a television, start watching a series and escape from reality. But suddenly, hours and hours have gone by and the one episode the user sat down to watch has now become many episodes. This problem of people losing track of time while watching series television shows is being called the “Netflix Effect.”</p>

        <p>People find that they cannot just watch one episode of a show because they have to find out what happens next. Then people find that they cannot just watch one season of a show because they were left hanging and need to find out what happens next.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the incredible psychological hooks that Netflix uses, it’s very hard to stop watching it. People lose their self control and cannot turn off the television even though they may want to. Then it rapidly include being late to work, not going outside to be active thereby gaining weight, closing themselves off from having a social life, not doing their chores.</p>

        <p>What if Netflix offer users the possibility to delegate all their household chores! Netflix subscribers will be able to order from their personal concierge all the goods (e.g. shopping) and services (e.g. cleaning,…) that they need.</p>

        <h3>Empathizing</h3>

        <p>I started off conducting interviews to collect qualitative data in hopes of extracting insights. At first, I was thinking that Netflix’s users will love the online conciergerie idea.</p>

        <p>But when looking at the interviews results, I wondered if this feature would add to the users’ Netflix experience. It seemed that the majority of the interviewees did not find the idea of having a Netflix conciergerie relevant. Out of 15 interviewees only 2 were interested by a conciergerie feature.</p>

        <p>So I did some online research in order to gain a better grasp on the target audience’s demographics, habits, and overall use of the Netflix. I did a second round of interviews, asking questions about their Netflix usage, habits.</p>

        <p>Did you know that 38% of Netflix subscribers are sometimes staying all weekend at home to watch movies ? Did you know that 43% of Netflix subscribers are staying up all night to watch movies ?</p>

        <p>And what goes best with a Netflix addiction ?</p>

        <p>Food and beverage delivery …</p>

        <h3>Ideation</h3>

        <p>Here is the idea to help Netflix stand out from its competitors. In the coming years, Netflix should massively invest in the food & drinks industry but with a little twist. Netflix should soon deliver to subscribers’ home the meal or drink discovered in a series that they dreamed of tasting ?</p>

        <p>Who hasn’t dreamed of eating Joe’s pizza ?</p>

        <p>Or Homer’s donuts ?</p>

        <p>Or even drinking Grace’s Margarita ?</p>

        <h3>Visual design documentation</h3>

        <p>After determining the navigation path, I studied the design of the brand to fully integrate the new functionality into the universe.

        <p>Netflix’s primary colors are black, red, and white. They also use secondary colors but we barely never use them.</p>

        <p>Netflix symbol is the N. It represents connection and a never-ending stream of stories to its subscribers. Simple and iconic, it instantly sparks brand recognition.</p>

        <p>The N symbol color palette always consists of two tones. This helps give it dimension and differentiate from the N within the full Netflix logo. The primary background for the N symbol is black. This is to emulate a premium cinematic feel as we continue to set the industry standard for original content.</p>

        <p>Netflix has its own custom typeface to be used across the streaming platform’s brand identity, developed by the in-house design team in partnership with foundry Dalton Maag.</p>

        <p>The typeface was created with both display aesthetics and more pragmatic functionality in mind, the uppercase proportions designed to appear “cinematic” and the lowercase proportions “compact and efficient”.</p>

        <h3>User flow</h3>

        <p>I highlighted in red our new feature. As you can see it is well integrated into the existing flow of the app.</p>

        <h3>Low-fi prototype</h3>

        <p>Then I created and tested a low-fidelity prototype. A video example is shown below.</p>

        <h3>Usability testing</h3>

        <p>During my usability testing, I tested 7 users. They gave me their first impression on the new feature. I collected a lot of insights.</p>

        <p>Aude-Isabelle, suggested me to review some wordings & interactions.</p>

        <p>Anne Sophie for example, wanted me to improve the cocktail display.</p>

        <p>Thomas asks me to work on the price display.</p>

        <h3>Iteration</h3>

        <p>I took all of this feedback and solved them in my high-fidelity prototype. I made use of more labeling and incorporated more of the user’s mental models in order to facilitate a seamless product.</p>

        <p>Here an example of a BEFORE / AFTER.</p>

        <p>I wanted to reproduce the Netflix Stack. What is it ? It is an endless, living catalog of shows and movies. It took us quite some time to get the right feeling and select the right brand volume.</p>

        <h3>High fi prototype</h3>

        <p>Finally it was time to created my high-fidelity prototype.</p>

        <h3>Key learnings</h3>

        <p>The testers found navigation easy to follow.</p>

        <p>They will use it if Netflix launch it. “I really like this feature, I think it could be something Netflix could really implement.” — Violeta</p>

        <h3>Next steps</h3>

        <p>This new feature should be improved, tested again and again.

        <p>In the short term, it will be great to give users the possibility to do their own cocktail with a Netflix cocktail tool kit delivered at their homes.</p>

        <p>In the mid term, work with the Marketing teams to develop brand’s collaborations with major actors of the food & drinks industry. Be the only distribution channel at first through our new feature.</p>

        <p>In the long term, let’s offer the possibility to Netflix users to stop an episode wherever they want and buy instantly whatever is appearing on screen (character’s clothes, furnitures, cocktails, …).</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Overall, this process was a very great learning experience.

        <p>I was super happy to challenge myself by working on a mobile application by my own from start to the end.

        <p>As I reflect on the past few weeks at Ironhack, I can’t believe how time has flown by! I learn new things every day, and my brain is definitely grateful!</p>

        <p>Here are the main things I learnt during this week focused on UI design:</p>

        <p>In order to become a good UI designer, you always need to train your eye, look out for great visual interfaces and patterns. By doing so, you identify the elements that make these interfaces so appealing and integrate these ideas into your work.</p>

        <p>As a UI designer, you need to be structured in everything you create. Atomic Design and layout grids give you a framework to design the best UIs that will convey emotions and push people to use your website/app.</p>

        <p>Learning about website/app accessibility, it opens new horizons, when designing for visually or physically impaired people for example. This actually contributes to improve the experience for everyone!</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoyed the read.</p>

        <p>Please note: This article was written as part of a speculative project which was not commissioned by Netflix. As a UX/UI Designer in training, I just chose to work on this topic because I love the app :)</p>
