      <h2>How to stay physically and mentally Healthy while COVID-19 has stuck you at home ?</h2>

      <h3>A UX/UI case study</h3>

      <p>Coaching Village, a Moroccan fitness camp, wanted to find a way to help their former participants to better handle this COVID-19 pandemie. They knew from experience that eating a balanced diet, exercising and getting good sleep are especially crucial for maintaining physical and mental well-being.</p>

      <p>My teammates, Manon, Constance and I were mandated by Coaching Village to help them find the perfect solution.</p>

      <p>We had one requirement: being able to track the user’s progress so that it would push them to commit to a healthier lifestyle. We aimed to identify an opportunity for an Healthcare Mobile App to improve their clients’ day-to-day lives.</p>

      <p>Three weeks ago, we presented the result of our UX researches, if you want to know more about it, you can read the article here.</p>

      <p>This article will focus on the UI part of the project.</p>

      <p>After interviewing former participants, we noticed that all of them wanted a way to better manage their return to real life !</p>

      <p>We created an app focusing on three points :</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learn how to train</li>
        <li>Learn how to eat</li>
        <li>Learn how to cook</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Our mid fi prototype</h3>

      <p>We assembled a prototype on Marvel, made of Mid-Fidelity screens done on Sketch. The goal was to test the usability of the MVP, and get general feedbacks from users. That’s why we decided to do a Mid-Fi prototype, which by essence don’t display any element of UI, so that testers don’t get distracted by the look of the App.</p>

      <p>Then we had to do some researches to find inspirations and started to build the base of your design.</p>

      <h3>Our brand attributes</h3>

      <p>To start, we defined 5 brand attributes for the visual identity of the app: motivation, community, personnalized, sportive spirit, exceeding limits. These values are the essence of Coaching Village and represent the feelings we wanted to convey when former participants enter the app.</p>

      <h3>Our moodboard</h3>

      <p>So the next step for us was to get the right “mood” for the App. You will see that, since our last discussion with Coaching Village team, we decided to propose a brand new visual identity.</p>

      <p>Indeed, we wanted to convey more the motivating, healthy and sportive atmosphere of Coaching Village.</p>

      <p>We gathered different pictures and merged it into a moodBoard.</p>

      <p>We used geometrical pattern to suggest the sportive spirit. We added some powerful pictures. The green “limits” painted with a brush is here to remind us that we should exceed your limits.</p>

      <h3>Our style tile</h3>

      <p>That testing lead us to our Style Tile. The style tile was what helped us to build consistency and give structure to our design.</p>

      <p>For our style tile, we used grey and orange as a primary color. Orange combines the power of red and the friendliness of yellow, it brings feelings of motivation and enthusiasm. It’s a great reminder of the spirit of Coaching Village.</p>

      <p>We balanced it with some touch of green for specific elements to have a positive and healthy feelings.</p>

      <p>Open Sans was a natural choice as we wanted a discreet typeface to balance with the brushy typeface of our pictures.</p>

      <p>We decide to use real pictures taken by the participants at Coaching Village.</p>

      <p>We also used simple icons.</p>

      <h3>Our usability testing and iterations</h3>

      <p>Even when you are working on the last stage of an app you have to test-it test-it and test it again to iterate and improve. Below you will see the evolution of our design.</p>

      <p>Based on our usability tests and feedbacks we managed to make the app more appealing and closer to the spirit convey by Coaching Village that is real and motivating.</p>

      <h4>Our iteration 1</h4>

      <p>In our first version we choose Unsplash images taken by professional. During the tests, we figured out that everyone was missing the joyful faces of Coaching Village participants. That’s why we decided to use only pictures taken at Coaching Village by participants.</p>

      <p>At the top right of the screen you can see three green dots. It’s a gauge showing the state of the user’s constants. We replace it by a full bar for more clarity.</p>

      <h4>Our iteration 2</h4>

      <p>For this screen, we decided to reduce the omnipresence of the grid and highlight the buttons for a better information hierarchy.</p>

      <h4>Our iteration 3</h4>

      <p>Then, we redesigned the access to the community sections in a similar way to the home page for more consistency.</p>

      <p>We also changed the footer menu to have a design closer to the general spirit.</p>

      <h3>Our desirability testing</h3>

      <p>We ended up doing fifteen desirability test to confirm that the brand values were well represented through the design.</p>

      <p>How did we proceed ?</p>

      <p>We showed some screens of our app during 3 seconds to 15 people and made them choose 5 words to best describe what they saw . The 3 words that came the most were : “SPIRITED”, “WHOLESOME”, “TRENDY”, which was a perfect fit for what we wanted to convey.</p>

      <p>And the testers gave us valuable feedbacks :</p>

      <h3>Our high fidelity prototype</h3>

      <p>You will find below the last version of our principal feature where the user can log-in, enter his constant of the day, access to his daily training and follow the steps on a scroll bar, access on his daily nutritional exercise. Each time he earns points to unlock recipes.</p>

      <h3>Our microinteractions</h3>

      <p>To improve the app navigation we decided to include microinteractions.</p>

      <p>Here, the idea was to let users know how to add their personal information regarding water, sleep, and physical activity.</p>

      <p>Here, we wanted to give the opportunity to users to follow their progresses with a progress bar. We decided also to show them their exercises one by one to avoid any distraction.</p>

      <p>Here, the objective is to clearly indicate that the missions have been successfully completed with the conversion of the red triangle in green check.</p>

      <h3>What did we learned?</h3>

      <p>This flow of iterations opens us to new opportunities. During all this process we realized that testing was a key to success. If you have any struggle to decide or you are hesitating you have to test and iterate. So in a further step, we would like to test more this application.</p>

      <p>Creating and improving our UX/UI process combined with ideation/decision brought fast and collective understanding to our day-to-day work. For sure, one of the greatest learnings while building this App.</p>

      <p>Collaboration in a remoted team was surely a challenge. We overcame it by having an extra care with communication, promoting intense collaboration at all times and never letting the ball drop.</p>

      <p>Having a structured step-by-step process, to validate and test ideas, ensures that we had our design thinking present in the app development process.We learned that we should always design the app as close as the Coaching Village bootcamp experience is.</p>

      <h3>Our next steps</h3>

      <p>In shorter-term (1 month) we will have to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Redesign high-fi prototypes based on usability test feedbacks.</li>
        <li>Run usability tests and iterate.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Afterwards, in the mid term, we wish to :</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Design all the features (account, recipes, community, …).</li>
        <li>Move on to development when the high fi prototype has been validated.</li>
        <li>Change the pictures of the app by organizing a dedicated shooting with some participants of Coaching Village.</li>
        <li>Add videos “Let’s cook with Khalid!” to encourage people to cook their meals properly without processed products.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>What made this experience so great and successful was the fact that we had such a good team. We knew the limits of each one of us, so it was easy to compensate each other, and we were able to communicate openly, putting ego aside and allowing each other to say their opinion.</p>

      <p>Another reason for all of this to work was that we followed the design thinking framework. As we are all UX/UI designers, it was just natural for us to follow the process which proved to be successful, especially when we had short limited time to work on this project. It gave us discipline and a set of tools.</p>

      <p>Special thanks to Constance and Manon. I learned so much from each one of you and you inspire me. Looking forward to working with you again.</p>

      <p>Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoyed the read.</p>

      <p>Please note: This case study was put together as part of a non-commercial research project for which I teamed up with fellow UX/UI Designers Constance Meury and Manon Philippe (April 2020). All comments/suggestions welcome :) !</p>
